POP Forums v15 is a forum app for ASP.NET Core, used as the base for several sites maintained by the author. It is not a science project, but a long-term commitment to great community.

The project goals include are: 
* Use ASP.NET Core.
* Keep the project open source.
* Be the best ASP.NET Core-based forum.
* Not duplicate UBB's 1998 UI for the Nth time.
* Localize: Now available in English, Spanish, German, Ukrainian, Dutch and Taiwanese Mandarin.

Do you speak English and another language? We want to make POP Forums globally useful. Since v9.2, the app is easily localized. Volunteers have translated to Spanish, Dutch, Ukrainian, Taiwanese Mandarin and German, and we'd love help for additional languages. Drop Jeff an e-mail to jeff@popw.com for more information.
