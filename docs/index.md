Do you speak English and another language? We want to make POP Forums globally useful. Since v9.2, the app is easily localized. Volunteers have translated to Spanish, Dutch, Ukrainian, Taiwanese Mandarin and German, and we'd love help for additional languages. Drop Jeff an e-mail to jeff@popw.com for more information.
